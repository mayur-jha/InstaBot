Instagram DM AutoResponder - Chrome Extension
==============================================

WHAT THIS IS:
A Chrome browser extension that automates Instagram DM responses using ChatGPT AI.
This runs entirely in your browser - no server or deployment needed!

HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Open Chrome and go to: chrome://extensions/

2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right corner)

3. Click "Load unpacked" button

4. Select the "extension" folder from this project

5. The extension icon should appear in your Chrome toolbar


HOW TO GET YOUR OPENAI API KEY:

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

2. Sign up or log in to OpenAI

3. Click "Create new secret key"

4. Copy the key (starts with "sk-")

5. IMPORTANT: Save it somewhere safe - you won't be able to see it again!


HOW TO USE:

1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar

2. Paste your OpenAI API key and click "Save"

3. Open Instagram Direct Messages: https://www.instagram.com/direct/inbox/

4. Click "Start Automation" in the extension popup

5. The extension will automatically:
   - Navigate to your Instagram Direct Messages
   - Go through each conversation one by one
   - Check if the last message is from the other user (not you)
   - Extract the last 20 messages for context
   - Send them to ChatGPT for analysis
   - Generate and send an appropriate response
   - Move to the next conversation


ADVANCED SETTINGS:

- Response Delay: Time to wait between processing conversations (default: 2000ms)
  * Increase this to avoid Instagram rate limits
  
- Messages to Analyze: How many recent messages to send to ChatGPT (default: 20)
  * More messages = better context but higher API costs


IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Make sure you're logged into Instagram before starting
- The extension ONLY responds when the other person sent the last message
- Your API key is stored locally in Chrome and NEVER shared
- You can stop the automation at any time by clicking "Stop"
- Use responsibly - Instagram may rate limit you if you send too many messages
- Each response uses your OpenAI API credits
- The extension works entirely in your browser - no external server needed


TROUBLESHOOTING:

- If it doesn't work, make sure you're on Instagram Direct Messages page
- Refresh the page if Instagram's layout has changed
- Check Chrome DevTools Console (F12) for any errors
- Make sure your API key is valid and has available credits
- If messages aren't being detected, Instagram may have updated their HTML structure
- Try increasing the Response Delay if you're being rate limited
- Make sure you've granted all permissions when loading the extension
- The extension needs permission to access instagram.com and api.openai.com

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

- Instagram frequently changes their DOM structure, so selectors may need updates
- The extension uses heuristics to detect message direction (from you vs from others)
- Rate limiting by Instagram may occur if you process too many messages too quickly
- API costs apply - each conversation analyzed uses OpenAI API credits
